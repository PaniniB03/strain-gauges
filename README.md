# Strain Gauges

## Overview
This project aims to use strain gauge sensors to measure the mechanical strain. It can be applied to the surface of dog bone test samples, or shank modules for AFO research, where the strain is measured parallel to the sensor. By using a Wheatstone bridge circuit with sensors and/or resistors, an HX711 Load cell amplifier, and a Wemos D1 R2, readings from the sensors can be converted to strain measurements.
